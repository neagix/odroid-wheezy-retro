This Debian Wheezy is a regular **armhf** (hard-float) Debian distro.

Ubuntu packages, like Debian packages, have dependencies.
You can try to install Ubuntu packages but if dependencies cannot be met in Debian (like too much recent libc version), it will not work.

You will need to compile that package (and all of its dependencies) yourself.

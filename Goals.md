# Project goals #

  * as much open source as possible (but no evangelism, don't worry), plus the proprietary vendor drivers for hardware acceleration
  * perfect for emulation but also for any other development need
  * lightweight plus some core packages always used to compile and develop
  * must be a serious work, so target audience is people that want to learn how to do things properly
  * attract developers & professionals to the ODROID community
  * attract developers for the [libretro API](http://www.libretro.org/)

## Regarding emulation ##

This project does not support any illegal activity and invites to use legal public domain ROMs and to develop your own. See also [Super NES Programming](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Super_NES_Programming)

## Regarding Open Source ##

The image is a pure Debian Wheezy (as released by odroid.us) except for the proprietray Mali400 binary blobs that you need for HardwareAcceleration
